# LED-SIGN
A project I did from initial concept to fully finished prototpe of a PCB of RGB LEDS displaying my name "DEAN"
A word document is attached describing the step by step process of creating an LED sign from the inital schematic to a fully functioning prototpye PCB manufactured from JLCPCB. All components that were used for the project (excpet the power supply) were purchased from eBay and were soldered by hand with a soldering iron.
